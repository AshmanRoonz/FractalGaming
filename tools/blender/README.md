# tools/blender — the LSS ship-model pipeline (headless Blender 4.1)

Everything here runs Blender **without a GUI** through its Python API (`bpy`). Nothing in
this folder ships to players; `LSS/` is the deploy root and only `tools/compress_glb.mjs`
writes GLBs into it.

## Requirements

- Blender 4.1.x — installed at `C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 4.1\blender.exe`
  (bundled glTF I/O add-on, EEVEE renders work in `--background`).
- Node deps for the compress step: `cd tools && npm install` (once).
- Python 3 with `numpy` + `Pillow` for the report/diff helpers.

## Folders

| folder | role |
| --- | --- |
| `assets_base/ships/` | **frozen inputs** — the v37.23 hulls exactly as shipped (byte-identical to `LSS/ships` at git `f6260f2`). Never edited. |
| `assets_src/ships/` | **Blender output** — float32, unquantized GLB written by the scripts here. This is what `compress_glb.mjs` reads. |
| `LSS/ships/` | **shipped** — written only by `node tools/compress_glb.mjs`. |
| `tools/blender/reports/` | JSON reports + renders from the last run (not needed at runtime). |

Why two source folders: the June art drop that `compress_glb.mjs` was written against is
no longer on disk, and the shipped hulls were already meshopt-simplified to 50%. So the
frozen shipped hulls are the new baseline, and the compress recipe runs with `simplify: 1.0`
for ships (see `OVERRIDES` in `compress_glb.mjs`) — simplifying twice would decimate to
~25% and bring back the surface wobble the 0.5 pass was tuned to avoid.

## Full rebuild (from the repo root)

```bash
"C:/Program Files/Blender Foundation/Blender 4.1/blender.exe" --background --python tools/blender/ship_cleanup.py -- --render
"C:/Program Files/Blender Foundation/Blender 4.1/blender.exe" --background --python tools/blender/verify_culled.py
python tools/blender/verify_culled_diff.py
node tools/compress_glb.mjs --only ships
```

Then bump `_MODELS_VERSION` in `LSS/index-working.html` (NOT `LSS_BUILD` — see the ASSET
CONTENT VERSIONS comment there) and run `python strip.py` from the repo root.
`python tools/gen_manifest.py` only needs re-running if the asset *tables* change.

## Scripts

- `ship_survey.py` — read-only: imports each GLB, prints topology stats, renders six views
  plus a pilot-POV from the `cockpit1` marker. Good first look at any new hull.
- `ship_cleanup.py` — **stage 1**. Per hull: deletes loose debris that sits inside the hull
  (never visible) and tiny slivers; fills tiny cracks (≤ 12-edge loops under 1.5% of hull
  length). It also detects faces whose front side points into the solid, but only flips them
  with `--flip-inverted`: the culled verification showed those are buried plates (0 pixels
  fixed, 0 broken from six vantages), so flipping is off by default. All edits go through
  edit-mode operators so the GLB's custom split normals survive. Keeps the `gun*` /
  `thruster*` / `cockpit1` markers.
- `verify_culled.py` + `verify_culled_diff.py` — renders before/after with backface culling
  ON and a transparent film from six vantages, then diffs the alpha: every enclosed
  transparent pixel is a hole the player could see through. `NEW` must be 0.

## Rules that bit us

- **Never let the ship recipe simplify twice.** `OVERRIDES` pins `simplify: 1.0`.
- **Markers are empty nodes.** `prune()` must keep leaves; `buildModelShipMesh` reads
  `/^gun\d+$/` and `/^thruster(\d+)$/` by name, and the cockpit work reads `cockpit1`.
- **In-game only the baseColor map survives.** `buildModelShipMesh` rebuilds materials
  keeping map / color / vertexColors / transparent / opacity — normal, roughness and
  emissive maps authored in Blender show only on the ship-select stage and hub traffic.
- **bmesh face order after `to_mesh()` is not creation order** — tag `material_index` on
  the `BMFace`, never by index range.
- Import with `merge_vertices=True` for real topology counts; the default import splits at
  UV seams and reports thousands of fake "loose parts".
- Forward axis = mean(gun markers) − mean(thruster markers); glTF space round-trips when
  the hierarchy is flattened, transforms applied, and `export_yup=True`.
